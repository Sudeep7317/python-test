# python-test
My pandas data frame is not working in either of jupyter, iPython and pycharm.
so I switched to R programming and also I've not studied about dummy time series yet, I only know about creating dummy variables of normal datasets while analysis.
I can create dummy time series, if i get little more time.
I just worked on analysis of moving average and little visualisation
